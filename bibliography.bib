    abstract = {Public information about one's coworkers, friends, family, and acquaintances, as well as one's associations with them, implicitly reveals private information.  Social-networking websites, e-mail, instant messaging, telephone, and VoIP are all technologies steeped in network dataâ€”data relating one person to another.  Network data shifts the locus of information control away from individuals, as the individual's traditional and absolute discretion is replaced by that of his social-network.  Our research demonstrates a method for accurately predicting the sexual orientation of Facebook users by analyzing friendship associations.  After analyzing 4,080 Facebook profiles from the MIT network, we determined that the percentage of a given user's friends who self-identify as gay male is strongly correlated with the sexual orientation of that user, and we developed a logistic regression classifier with strong predictive power.  Although we studied Facebook friendship ties, network data is pervasive in the broader context of computer-mediated communication, raising significant privacy issues for communication technologies to which there are no neat solutions.},

decentralized P2P networks operating in a restricted-route environment with malicious participants.  We have implemented our routing algorithm and have evaluated its performance under various topologies and in the presence of malicious peers.  For small-world topologies, our algorithm provides significantly better performance when compared to existing methods. In more densely connected topologies, our performance is better than or on par with other designs.},

We have implemented CADET and evaluated its performance in various network scenarios, compared it to the well-known TCP/IP stack and tested its response to rapidly changing network
topologies. While our current implementation is still significantly
slower in high-speed low-latency networks, for typical Internet-usage our system provides much better connectivity and security with comparable performance to TCP/IP.},
